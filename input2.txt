now what i want to do is introduce some of the operational aspects of the class we have some handouts going around if you did not get them we can get you extras but again this is all posted at the website so you know who i am the key person in this operation is my administrative assistant hillary sheldon and she is just down the hall you can roll a penny down the hall from here and get to my office if you tell me you tried to look for me and you could not find me i know you could not have been trying very hard the text is a twovolume set consisting of the text chemistry principles patterns and applications by averill and eldredge then a second volume that consists of miscellaneous readings taken from other prentice hall texts and it is identical in content to the blue book that was used last year and the year before so if you get a copy that have blue book you do not have to buy these i do not work for prentice hall i am not trying to sell books but you know we will take the homeworks out of the books to the great extent and the page numbering is the same so anything in this year or the last 2 years will be fine if you have to buy something you will have this this one will come with a cd that will get you into a mastering chemistry which is a sort of tutorial computerized system to help you with certain homework problems the lectures monday wednesday friday here in this room at a lecture starts at 5 minutes after the hour it gives you five minutes to get in and then the lecture stops at minutes to the next hour time for you to leave and then for the next class to arrive what we are going to try to do is establish some plug flow here so what i am going to try is to have everybody leave by the exit to the north here to my right and theres also an exit over the top back so you leave to your left and that way it will be easier for the next class to come in maybe we can persuade the people here before us to do the same and that will be easy to change i do not know why but theres this sort of everybody has to charge to this door and i am just standing here and watching people collide i dont know it is an interesting social experiment there are two doors i do not understand why people do this but im not in the social sciences recitations will meet tuesdays and thursdays so youll go to the same hour on tuesday and thursday the section should be roughly students thats where the question and answer occurs here its largely i talk you listen ive got a time for questions like hey should not that be a minus sign i can take something really quick but where you get to really interact with the instructor is in recitation and ive given a direction to my recitation instructor not to give you a fourth and fifth lecture you control the content of the recitation you have to come to the recitation prepared with questions theyre supposed to walk in and say good morning good afternoon what are your questions and you can say i did not understand the last 5 minutes of the lecture yesterday would you do number on the homework would you go over secondary bonding thats the sort of thing thats supposed to happen in section you have been assigned by the registrar you are forbidden to change your section on your own you can not just squat in another section we do this with the intention of trying to keep the enrollment roughly uniform we do not want sections growing to because then that limits your ability to interact if youve changed classes or youve picked up a urop what have you your situation has changed please go down the hall and meet with my assistant hillary who will then arrange to move you and that way we can keep some control over the section size again you may not change simply on your own and it has to be with cause academic cause you can not go in and say i was assigned to the am section and i do not do morning thats not going to work homework homework is very important here homework is a little bit different though in youre not going to be asked to turn in homework for grading instead at the beginning of each unit you will be given homework with the model solutions right at the beginning this is a study aid you can use the model solutions to help you understand the homework material
