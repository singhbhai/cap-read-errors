electrochemistry is the most important branch of chemistry you notice some theme in my professional life see i have tenure so what does that mean it means you find your passion and pursue it you do not waste time on trivia that is what i urge you to do find your passion and pursue it so what is my passion my passion is electrochemistry and nonaqueous media anything but water let the rest of the world work on water work on ionic liquid polymers what is the reason for this theres no application i am in the school of engineering i am interested in environmentally sound technologies for metal production right now looking at titanium iron recycling as well also interested in electrochemistry as it applies to energy storage energy storage for mobile power see this gal here she has the cell phone shes not even looking where she is driving so making safe batteries out of earth abundant accessible materials for portable power ultimately to drive the car with electrons electric fuel to eliminate this countrys dependence on imported petroleum we can do it how by inventing by inventing and the way we are going to invent is to learn the lessons in 3091 that will give us the chemistry we need to invent the battery that can send that car miles on a single charge and put it in the showroom for the same price as a car with an internal combustion engine the only thing that stands between that image and where we are today is invention and the requisite material is right here in this class also looking at colossal batteries store the grid enable renewables wind solar and then lastly lets never forget about dreaming so if we want to dream and imagine that man will return to the moon or maybe even go to mars we are going to have to be able to produce oxygen a little like the pioneers produce oxygen from local produce resources structural metals and even produce photovoltaic silica so they can generate their own energy from local resources and so electrochemistry is the key enabler for that as well now lets turn to the whole underpinning of 3091 and if we take a look at the performance of engineering any engineering system it is a combination of the design and a construction now the construction is both the workmanship and the choice of materials now how do we choose materials we choose them on the basis of their properties so for example heres an application a beverage container this what i am holding is made out of an aluminum alloy it is a metal when i was your age they had steel cans you can take this same beverage and contain it in a glass bottle you can contain it in a polymer bottle why do we make those various choices because they have the right mix of properties now how do you determine the properties properties obviously are determined by the composition i would not make this thing out of sodium chloride it would dissolve the composition is important but atomic arrangement is important as well example is half inch thick pine board compared to a half inch thick piece of plywood both pine but the half inch thick pine board is one solid pine board i can take that pine board and i can fracture it if i strike it along the grain but the half inch thick plywood i cant do that because it is eighth inch sheet pine cross laminated inch north south eighth inch eastwest eigth inch north south eighth inch eastwest if i try to cut through that board i cant advance the fracture same composition different atomic arrangement the thesis of is that the electronic structure of the elements holds the key to understanding that relationship between composition atomic arrangement and properties once you have properties thats how you make your selection and away we go thats how we got the syllabus of 3091 the syllabus has 2 major blocks first block is general principles of chemistry going to be about the first 5 weeks and thats the same stuff that you get here the basics of electronic structure and bonding then we part company and in 3091 we dig down into solid state chemistry you do not have to take notes you can relax all of this is going to be burned to pdf and posted at the website so everything that you see in this class that goes up on the screen is archived for you this lecture is being video recorded right now and within an hour it will be posted at the website so in the unlikely event that you cant quite come to class it is available
